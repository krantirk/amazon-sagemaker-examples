# Breast Cancer Example

This example notebook shows how to use Sagemaker's linear-learner to predict breast cancer. It demonstrates the following:
* Basic setup for using Sagemaker.
* converting datasets to the recordIO format used by the Amazon SageMaker algorithms and uploading to user provided S3 bucket.
* Training Sagemaker's linear learner on the data set.
* Hosting the trained model for scoring.
* Scoring using the trained model.
